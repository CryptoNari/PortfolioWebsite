# Portfolio Website

This project is a learn to code project published on https://www.freecodecamp.org/.
I used it to refresh my Frontend development skills and followed the tutorial Video created by MacLinz.


## Tech Stack

Instead of following the tutorial from start, I decided to setup a 'webpack' dev environment first.
After using it in the "Udacity - Frontend Web Developer - nanodegree" I wanted to follow up with some practice here.

node - 16.14.2 

webpack - 5.71.0 


## Installation

Install my-project with npm
cd into the project directory and run:

```bash
  npm install 
```
    
To start the webpack dev server run:

```bash
  npm run start
```

To compile the project with webpack run:

```bash
  npm run build
```

The dist folder will now hold the relevant files for deployment.
## Course topics

-   Introduction
-   Switch Between Sections
-   Header Content

## Follow up

By trying to get a clean scss structure and reading some "Best Practise" advices I decided to leave the project in current state.
I'll take some lessons and start a new portfolio Page with some new design ideas and possible adjustments.

The biggest difference to this tutorial project should be in organizing scss as follows:

Structuring Sass Projects
-   with partial files
-   mobile first
